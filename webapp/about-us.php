            <h3>J.E.D.I Bio</h3>
			<img src="http://gp1.wac.edgecastcdn.net/802892/production_public/Photo/3206435/image/thumb/DSCN0240_1285551277.jpg" alt="" height="125" class="alignleft bdr1 heffect" /> J.E.D.I Entertainment (Jealousy Encourage Driven Intelligence) is a Pittsburgh based music label, building a strong foundation to be able to grow into a nationally known business and producer of hot music. The idea behind the name came from the ideology that, if you see something you want do not become jealous of those who have it. Instead allow that urge to drive you to find a way to obtain it yourself, your jealousy should encourage you to be motivated in a intelligent way.<br />
            <br />
            <p>The brain child of Pittsburgh native Jonathan Hughes and with the assistance of Simon Lewis J.E.D.I hopes to contend with other well-known independent labels. J.E.D.I Entertainment is working to be the most formidable force in music, not only in Pittsburgh but on a national level. Through its experience in marketing and promotion, J.E.D.I has the ability to push itself into the sight of its fans and consumers.</p>
            <p>J.E.D.I is not growing or working to shush critics; or to stop the growth and progression of its competition. They are actually building a network of professional, ethical and business relationships to build a company that will last for years to come. </p>
